# Memory Subsystem Development

Parallel development workspace for the MCP Knowledge Service memory layer.

## Structure
- `src/` - Core memory subsystem implementation
- `tests/` - Unit and integration tests  
- `benchmarks/` - Performance testing suite
- `docs/` - Implementation-specific documentation
- `examples/` - Usage examples and integration demos

## Integration with /home/ubuntu/mcp
This workspace develops the memory subsystem components that integrate with the main MCP service in `/home/ubuntu/mcp`.

Refer to `/home/ubuntu/mcp/docs/memory-design.md` for the complete design specification.

## Quick Start
See the memory-design.md for architecture overview and development phases.
